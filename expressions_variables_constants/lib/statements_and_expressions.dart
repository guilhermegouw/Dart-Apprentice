// Statements
// A statement is a command, something you tell the computer
// to do. In Dart, all simple statements end with a semicolon.
// You've already seen that with the print statement:
void main() {
  print('Hello, Apprentice!!!'); // the semicolon ";" is necessary!
  int truth = 42;
  if (truth == 42) {
    print("Truth!");
  }
}
// semicolon on the right finishes the statement.
// People coming from languages that don't require semicolons may
// think they-re unnecessary. However, due to Dart's special syntax and 
// features, semicolons give the compiler the context it needs to properly
// understand the code.


// Expressions
// Unlike a statement, an expression doesn't do something; it is
// something. That is, an expression is a value, or is something that can 
// be calculated as a value.
//
// 42
// 3 + 2
// 'Hello, World!'
